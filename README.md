# Encrypted-Data-transmission-using-Morse-Code
This project is implemented with the idea of sending information from one place to another by encoding it in Morse Code. We have used BCD numbers from 0-9 and encoded it in Morse Code. This information is sent through the transmission lines and decoded to display the information in both Morse code and decimal numbers using seven-segment display.
